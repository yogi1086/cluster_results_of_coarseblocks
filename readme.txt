These are the raw data of the three cases in our manuscript.

The "fine-scale model.tif" is the fine-scale model of the case. 

The local permeabilities are normalized and shown in "local_permeability_after_normalization" folder. The file name "n_m.png" represents that it is the coarse block in row n and column m of the model. 

In "cluster_results"  folder, each subfloder is one cluster. For example, Case 1 has 405 clusters, Case 2 has 471 clusters.
